        Good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking Professor Sambeet for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. We first met many years ago at NTNU in Trondheim, where we were both doing our PhD research stay. I was focused on computer science, and he was focused on power systems. Since then, we've have continued to collaborate in the field of Energy Informatics. That's why I'm here with you today.
